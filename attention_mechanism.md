# Attention Mechanism

The **Attention Mechanism** is a crucial concept in deep learning, primarily used in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models for tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, and image captioning. It was first introduced by **Bahdanau et al. (2014)** to address the limitations of traditional encoder-decoder architectures.

## 1. Motivation: The Bottleneck Problem

In traditional seq2seq models, the encoder compresses the entire input sequence into a **fixed-length vector** (context vector), which the decoder then uses to generate the output. This approach creates a bottleneck, especially for long or complex sequences, as important information may be lost.

### **Solution: Attention Mechanism**

Instead of relying on a single fixed-length context vector, the attention mechanism allows the decoder to **dynamically focus on different parts of the input** at each time step.

## 2. Key Components of the Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism operates in three main steps:

### **(a) Alignment Scores**

The alignment score determines how much focus the decoder should place on each encoder hidden state.

\[ e_{ti} = a(s_t, h_i) \]

Where:
- \( h_i \) is the hidden state of the encoder at time step \( i \)
- \( s_t \) is the hidden state of the decoder at time step \( t \)
- \( a(s_t, h_i) \) is the alignment model, typically implemented as:

\[ e_{ti} = v^T \tanh(W_s s_t + W_h h_i) \]

### **(b) Attention Weights**

After computing alignment scores, we apply a softmax function to obtain attention weights:

\[ \alpha_{ti} = \frac{\exp(e_{ti})}{\sum_{j} \exp(e_{tj})} \]

These weights determine the importance of each encoder hidden state in generating the current output.

### **(c) Context Vector**

The context vector \( c_t \) is computed as a weighted sum of all encoder hidden states:

\[ c_t = \sum_{i} \alpha_{ti} h_i \]

This context vector dynamically changes at each decoding step, allowing the decoder to selectively focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.

## 3. Application in Sequence-to-Sequence Models

At each decoding step:
1. The previous decoder hidden state \( s_{t-1} \) is used to compute alignment scores.
2. Softmax is applied to obtain attention weights.
3. The context vector \( c_t \) is computed using a weighted sum of encoder states.
4. The decoder generates the next token using both \( c_t \) and \( s_t \).

### **Advantages:**
‚úîÔ∏è Overcomes the fixed-length bottleneck
‚úîÔ∏è Improves performance on long and complex sequences
‚úîÔ∏è Enhances interpretability by visualizing attention weights

## 4. Beyond RNNs: Attention in Transformers

- The attention mechanism was later generalized in the **Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017)**.
- Transformers use **self-attention**, where each token attends to all other tokens in the sequence.
- This led to the development of models like **BERT, GPT, and T5**.

## 5. Example: English-to-French Translation

**Input:** _"I love deep learning"_

**Output:** _"J'adore l'apprentissage profond"_

| Source Tokens | J'  | adore | l'  | apprentissage | profond |
|--------------|----|------|----|--------------|--------|
| I            | 0.8  | 0.1  | 0.0  | 0.05  | 0.05  |
| love         | 0.1  | 0.8  | 0.0  | 0.05  | 0.05  |
| deep         | 0.0  | 0.05 | 0.1  | 0.4  | 0.45  |
| learning     | 0.0  | 0.05 | 0.8  | 0.5  | 0.45  |

This attention matrix shows which input words contribute most to the output tokens.
