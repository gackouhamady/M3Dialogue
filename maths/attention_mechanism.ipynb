    "# Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Attention Mechanism** is a crucial concept in deep learning, primarily used in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models for tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, and image captioning. It was first introduced by **Bahdanau et al. (2014)** to address the limitations of traditional encoder-decoder architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Motivation: The Bottleneck Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional seq2seq models, the encoder compresses the entire input sequence into a **fixed-length vector** (context vector), which the decoder then uses to generate the output. This approach creates a bottleneck, especially for long or complex sequences, as important information may be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Solution: Attention Mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying on a single fixed-length context vector, the attention mechanism allows the decoder to **dynamically focus on different parts of the input** at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Key Components of the Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism operates in three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(a) Alignment Scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "The alignment score determines how much focus the decoder should place on each encoder hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e_{ti} = a(s_t, h_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( h_i \\) is the hidden state of the encoder at time step \\( i \\)\n",
    "- \\( s_t \\) is the hidden state of the decoder at time step \\( t \\)\n",
    "- \\( a(s_t, h_i) \\) is the alignment model, typically implemented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e_{ti} = v^T \\tanh(W_s s_t + W_h h_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(b) Attention Weights**\n",
    "\n",
    "After computing alignment scores, we apply a softmax function to obtain attention weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_{ti} = \\frac{\\exp(e_{ti})}{\\sum_{j} \\exp(e_{tj})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These weights determine the importance of each encoder hidden state in generating the current output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(c) Context Vector**\n",
    "\n",
    "The context vector \\( c_t \\) is computed as a weighted sum of all encoder hidden states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_t = \\sum_{i} \\alpha_{ti} h_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This context vector dynamically changes at each decoding step, allowing the decoder to selectively focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Application in Sequence-to-Sequence Models\n",
    "\n",
    "At each decoding step:\n",
    "1. The previous decoder hidden state \\( s_{t-1} \\) is used to compute alignment scores.\n",
    "2. Softmax is applied to obtain attention weights.\n",
    "3. The context vector \\( c_t \\) is computed using a weighted sum of encoder states.\n",
    "4. The decoder generates the next token using both \\( c_t \\) and \\( s_t \\).\n",

    "## 4. Beyond RNNs: Attention in Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "- The attention mechanism was later generalized in the **Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017)**.\n",
    "- Transformers use **self-attention**, where each token attends to all other tokens in the sequence.\n",
    "- This led to the development of models like **BERT, GPT, and T5**.\n",
